# Docker Final Task - BitCoin Values

Create a Python Web APP using FLASK that:  
● Presents the Current BitCoin Price (LIVE)  
● Stores the price in a Redis Database  
● Presents the Average Price for the last 10 minutes (LIVE) 

Dockerize the applications by Creating Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file.

## Redis Database:
### Use cases:

#### Real-time data store
Redis' versatile in-memory data structures let you build data infrastructure for real-time applications requiring low latency and high-throughput.

#### Caching & session storage
Redis' speed makes it ideal for caching database queries, complex computations, API calls, and session state.

#### Streaming & messaging
The stream data type enables high-speed data ingestion, messaging, event sourcing, and notifications.
